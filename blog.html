      <h3>No class all week?!</h2>
      <h5>November 18, 2018</h5>
      
      <p>I had the best sleep all week and I woke up to an even better surprise: an email saying class was cancelled for the week! I had woken up at 10:35 and went straight to the UC Davis rideshare page and found a ride at 11:30. Say goodbye to 3 midterms on Monday. Now they'll probably be postponed or cancelled. I guess it's nice to have a week off for Thanksgiving. On the way home, we passed by a bunch of cops gathered around a house that had burned down in the middle of the night. It turned out that one person died, and my sister was actually close friends with her. All these incidents going on in California are pretty scary. Even now, the fire is only ~60% contained but the air quality is still really bad</p>

      <h3>SacHacks! My first hackathon</h2>
      <h5>November 17, 2018</h5>
      
      <p>Today I went to my first hackathon. I wanted to go in with an open mind, but also with zero expectations. Woke up at 6 am and drove over w my team. We actually showed up a bit too early so we got breakfast at Chick Fil A. I've never had Chick Fil A for breakfast before but since they make their chicken in the morning, my spicy chicken deluxe burger was the best chicken I've ever had. While we were waiting, we came up with our project: a subleasing site that lets the user type in a location, and we display a few locations from Craigslist. The problem is none of us had any experience with Javascript so it was really tough to do and we struggled for the most part. The hackacthon was supposed to end at 10 am the next day but we burned out at 5 pm and decided to just dip. Overall I had a lot of fun and I definitely learned a lot from it. Plus I got a lot of free stuff so I'm not complaining especially since the entire event was free. </p>
