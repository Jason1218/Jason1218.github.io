      <h2>Class cancelled!</h2>
      <h5>November 18, 2018</h5>
      
      <p>I had the best sleep all week and I woke up to an even better surprise: an email saying class was cancelled for the week! I had woken up at 10:35 and went straight to the UC Davis rideshare page and found a ride at 11:30. Say goodbye to 3 midterms on Monday. Now they'll probably be postponed or cancelled. I guess it's nice to have a week off for Thanksgiving. On the way home, we passed by a bunch of cops gathered around a house that had burned down in the middle of the night. It turned out that one person died, and my sister was actually close friends with her. All these incidents going on in California are pretty scary. Even now, the fire is only ~60% contained but the air quality is still really bad</p>
